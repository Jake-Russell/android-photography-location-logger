          <p class="column-description-text">A review of a location can be added by going to the app's Add Review screen.</p>

          <p class="column-description-text">Upon first opening this page, the app will check to see if there are any existing reviewd locations near you,
          as this could be the location that you wish to review as well. If there are any within a 500m radius of your current location, then you will
          be presented with a popup, asking if it is the location you wish to review. If there are multiple potential locations, then these popup suggestions
          will appear in order of distance from you, as to try and suggest the correct location as quickly as possible.</p>

          <p class="column-description-text">Pressing 'Yes' will automatically fill in the location name, so you don't need to do so. Pressing 'No' will then
          close the popup, so you can add your review. Alternatively, if there are other potential locations nearby, then these will be suggested too.</p>

          <img src="./images/location-suggestion-popup.png" alt="">

          <p class="column-description-text">Only if the location you are trying to review does not already exist will you be able to provide the Location Name.</p>

          <p class="column-description-text">You can give the location a rating out of 5 Stars by sliding your finger along the star rating bar. The stars increment by 0.5
          to allow you to give the location a precise rating.</p>

          <p class="column-description-text">A review can be written in the 'Review' field. The text area will automatically grow if you write more than one line, so your
          review can be as long and in depth as you wish!</p>

          <p class="column-description-text">Adding an image to your review is a really quick and easy process. Simply choose between uploading an image, or taking one with
          your device's camera by clicking the corresponding button.</p>

          <img src="./images/add-review-add-image-buttons.png" alt="">

          <p class="column-description-text">If you choose to upload an image, you will be taken to a content picker, where you will be able to choose an image from a range of
          different locations on your device.</p>

          <p class="column-description-text">If you choose to take an image, you will be taken to the camera, where you will be able to take an image. Once you have taken the image,
          you can accept it by pressing the tick in the bottom right corner, or retake it by pressing the cross in the bottom left corner. Note that if this is your first time using the app,
          or you have previously declined camera permissions, you will need to allow this permission in order to use the camera.</p>

          <img src="./images/camera-permissions.png" alt="">

          <p class="column-description-text">Once you have either selected an image from the content picker, or taken one from the camera, you will be presented with an 'Uploading' dialog.
          It is important that you do not click away from this dialog, as the image may not be uploaded successfully.</p>

          <p class="column-description-text">After the image has finished uploading, you will see a small thumbnail of it in the app. Since only one photo upload is allowed per review,
          you will also see that the 'Upload Image', and 'Take Image' buttons have been removed and replaced with a 'Remove Image' button. This can be pressed to delete the image, and then
          allow you to choose a new one.</p>

          <p class="column-description-text">Underneath the image, you will find a 'Submit Review' button so that you can submit the review.</p>

          there is only one review with an image. An image can be clicked on to enlarge it. The enlarged image will be shown in a popup window. Clicking the cross in the top right
          corner of this popup window will close it.</p>

          <img src="./images/close-popup-image.png" alt="">

          <p class="column-description-text">An image can also be long clicked to save it to your gallery. Note that if this is your first time using the app, or you have
          previously declined external read / write permissions, then you will need to allow this permission in order to save the image. Once permissions have been granted, you will
          see another popup, asking you to confirm that you wish to save the image. Pressing 'Yes' will save the image to your gallery and close the popup. Pressing 'No', will not
          save the image, and close the popup.</p>
